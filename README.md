# Calendar App 

I stumbled on this coding challenge when I was browsing on [r/front_end](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/). The expected completion
time was 1.5 hours, which I felt, and still do, was unreasonable. This was a great challenge to learn a lot about React and Redux,
and helped me with structuring my React code a little better than what I was initially doing. I spend a lot of time on this app,
and ignored the 1.5 hours because I really wanted to learn/understand how Redux works with React in a more practical sense. 

Side note: My app is heavily influenced by Google's Calendar App, and I have no shame. Google's calendar app is amazing, and I wanted
to pay homage to their app.
